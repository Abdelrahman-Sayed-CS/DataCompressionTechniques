# CompressionTechniques

## The LZW (Lemuel-Ziv-Welch) compression technique is a lossless data compression(compress text) algorithm.

### Here's a brief overview of how the LZW algorithm works:

1) Dictionary Initialization:<br>
The algorithm starts with an initial dictionary containing individual characters or symbols.

2) Compression:<br>
It reads the input data and identifies repeated patterns or sequences.
Each identified sequence is replaced with a code that represents it, effectively reducing the size of the data.
The algorithm dynamically updates the dictionary as new sequences are encountered, assigning codes to them.

3) Decompression:<br>
During decompression, the compressed data and the dictionary are used to reconstruct the original data.
The compressed data is scanned, and codes are replaced with their corresponding sequences using the dictionary.

The key advantage of LZW is its ability to adapt to the input data, 
creating a dynamic dictionary that evolves during the compression process. 
This allows it to efficiently encode repeated patterns, 
making it particularly effective for compressing text files and other types of data with redundant structures.
