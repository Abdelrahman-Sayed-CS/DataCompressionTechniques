# Vector Quantization

## Vector quantization (VQ) is a technique used in signal processing and data compression(compress images) to represent a set of vectors by a smaller set of representative vectors, known as codewords. This process helps reduce the amount of data needed to represent the original set of vectors while preserving essential characteristics.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how vector quantization works:<br>

1) Vector Space: Consider a set of multidimensional vectors in a vector space. These vectors could represent data such as images, audio signals, or any other form of information.<br>

2) Codebook: Create a codebook, which is a collection of representative vectors (codewords). These codewords are chosen to capture the essential features of the input vectors.<br>

3) Quantization: Assign each input vector to the codeword in the codebook that is closest to it in terms of some distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). This process is known as quantization.<br>

4) Encoding: Instead of representing each input vector with its full set of values, represent it by the index or code of the codeword to which it has been quantized. This index is typically much smaller than the original vector.<br>

5) Decoding: To reconstruct the original vector, use the codeword associated with its index in the codebook. The reconstructed vector may not be identical to the original, but the goal is to minimize the distortion introduced during quantization.<br>
